=============
``divvy.fps``
=============

Welcome to the **divvy.fps** documentation site.

**divvy.fps** is a python library for integrating your website with
Amazon's Flexible Payment Service (FPS).  The project is brand new and
currently under heavy development.  The initial goal of divvy.fps is
to support the FPS "Basic Quick Start" API in it's entirety.  It would
be great if eventually divvy.fps supported the entire Amazon FPS API.

If you would like to help in the
development of divvy.fps, read the Getting Started section.
